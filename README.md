### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: Is There Any Similarity between Philosophy Schools? Can We Roughly Understand Philosophy by Algorithms?
+ This project is conducted by [Nichole Zhang]

+ Project summary: Philosophy is hard to understand for most of us who are not majoring in Philosophy. However, is it feasible for us to learn more about Philosophy with the help of algorithms? In this project, I use the dataset from Kaggle to find the similarities from different schools through different dimensions. The first dimension is finding high-frequency words in each school and clustering schools with similar topics. The second dimension is using a sentiment analysis algorithm to cluster schools with similar emotions. The second part of this project is trying to use high-frequency words to find the main idea of some schools. Feminism, Rationalism, and Empiricism are taken as examples. By doing some filterings, we can find the main idea.
