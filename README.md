### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: Is There Any Similarity between Philosophy Schools? Can We Roughly Understand Philosophy by Algorithms?
+ This project is conducted by [Nichole Zhang]

+ Project summary: Philosophy is hard to understand for most of us who are not majoring in Philosophy. However, is it feasible for us to learn more about Philosophy with the help of algorithms? In this project, I use the dataset from Kaggle to find the similarities from different schools through different dimensions and try to extract main ideas from some schools' texts.
